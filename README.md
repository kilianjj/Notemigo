This is my attempt at building an app that combines note-taking and flashcards into a single experience. While there are many apps that excel at one or the other, I haven’t found one that merges both in a way that feels truly cohesive.

In my own studies, notes, flashcards, and other learning materials all play important roles depending on the subject. Ideally, I’d like a single tool that could manage multiple learning formats seamlessly. So, this is the start of my very unpolished implementation of an "all-in-one" studying solution.
